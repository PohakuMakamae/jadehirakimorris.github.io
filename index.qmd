# Welcome to my website!

I am Jade Hiraki Morris, and I am currently a graduate student at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. I am working towards obtaining a masters degree in biology. I am working in the coastal ecology lab here on campus with my advisor Dr. Jayson Smith. On this website, I offer a glimpse into my ongoing research journey!

My research interests include marine ecology and the rocky intertidal zone. I have done quite a lot of research along the southern California coastline looking at biodiversity and community ecology. I have also been researching a new species of copepod found living inside the shells of hermit crabs along Palos Verdes Peninsula, California.

I work as a teaching assistant and have taught two semesters of BIO1220L - Evolution Ecology and Biodiversity Lab, here on campus. I also work as an educator at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro, California. I work as a field researcher for the coastal ecology lab at Cal Poly. I also work with an environmental consulting company as a technical scuba diver and field technician.

On this website, you will find a selection of my project, photos, and CV which I hope to update as I continue my academic career. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:jhmorris@cpp.edu) if you have any questions.
